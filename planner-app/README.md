# ABOUT THE LOCATION WIDGET:

### WHY THE LOCATION WIDGET?

The location widget is an appropriate custom widget added to the planner app as it provides valuable information to the users. It enhances the app's functionality by displaying the user's current location as name of city and Geographical Coordinates of the city, which can be useful in various scenarios. For example, it can assist users in determining their geographical coordinates, tracking their movements, or providing location-specific data or services.

### HOW TO USE THE LOCATION WIDGET:

To use the location widget,
1. users simply need to have the planner app opened on their device.
2. then users should allow the app to know their location when prompted by the browser.

### HOW THE LOCATION WIDGET WORKS:
Once the app is allowed to know the user's location, the widget is added and displayed, it automatically fetches the user's current location using the browser's geolocation API. The widget then fetches the city name by reverse geocoding using MapQuest Geocoding API.

Finally, the name of city, latitude and longitude coordinates are then displayed in the widget, allowing users to easily access and utilize their location information.

The location widget can be especially beneficial for the user as it provides a functionality that requires knowledge of the user's whereabouts. It enhances user experience, provides convenience and context-aware features within the app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
